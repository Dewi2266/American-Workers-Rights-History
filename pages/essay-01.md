# The Bloody Fight for Workers Rights

## Introduction

The Bloody Fight for Worker's Rights (ROUGH DRAFT)

Imagine working in a cramped, dark, and loud area for 12 hours, only to get a measly day’s pay for the awful working conditions. That was a part of everyday life if you were an American worker in the early 20th century. It's no secret that working conditions in America have not always been good. But with the abundance of workers consistently flocking to America for work and progressive activists pushing for fair wages and treatment, it was only a matter of time before worker’s rights legislation would be passed. It took activists many years of protesting, organizing unions, and reshaping how people thought of work to achieve workers' rights. This essay is on critical legislation and events that aided workers' rights throughout American history.

The Gilded Age refers to a time in American history spanning the 1870s to the early 1900s. Mark Twain coined the term to describe America's golden on the outside, dirty and dull on the inside. One of the more notable fights for workers' rights during the gilded age was the Homestead strikes. The Homestead strikes were a series of riots between workers and the Carnegie Steel company. The men in charge of the Carnegie steel company were Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick. It all began in 1892 when the workers of the Homestead Steel Mill received a wage cut. The workers (who were all a part of a union) began to strike. Operations Manager Henry Frick responded to the strike by firing all 3,800 workers.
Soon after firing his workers, Frick hired 300 Pinkerton detectives to occupy the plant. This was the start of something horrible just waiting to happen. The workers knew of the Pinkertons trying to settle the plant, so in response, they all rushed to the plant to stop the Pinkertons. What happened next was a bloodbath. According to an eyewitness account, when the workers got to the pier, they tried to talk the Pinkertons out of landing their boats, but instead, the Pinkerton in charge said: “ Men, we are Pinkerton detectives. We were sent here to take possession of this property and guard it for the company. We don't wish to shed blood, but we are determined to go up there and shall do so. If you men don't withdraw, we will mow every one of you down and enter in spite of you. You had better disperse, for land we will!” (Stowell, Myron R.)  An hour and a half passed in a silent standoff between the workers and the Pinkertons before the Pinkertons finally started to get out of their boats. As soon as they began to make their way, The detectives met them with a volley of shots from the workers. The Pinkertons returned to tier boats and started to shoot back.
A gunfight between the workers and the Pinkertons broke out and lasted until Noon the next day until the Pinkertons Surrendered. Then after that, Henry Frick got the Governor to Send the National Guard, and the plant was relinquished from the workers. In the end, the Union gave in to reduced wages and 12 hour days, for their violent treatment against Pinkerton agents took away their public support. If this strike was unsuccessful, then why talk about it? At this point in American history, “Robber Barons” held most of the power and influence in America. If something did not go their way, they were willing to kill people and manipulate politicians to do their bidding just to get their way. This way of life for Robber Barons would not last long, for the fight for workers' rights is continuous. 

The Ludlow Massacre was an event that happened in April 1914 in Ludlow, Colorado. It was an attack on striking coal miners and their families from Colorado Fuel and Iron Company guards. The event occurred when 10,000 miners had been on strike since September; they protested low pay and horrible working conditions. An eyewitness account stated: “Since last September, these people had been taught nothing but peace. Their leaders had told them day after day that they could never hope to make the disinterested citizen understand their side of the controversy unless they strictly obeyed every law and "attended to their own business.” (Fink, Walter)  The workers were under the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Since they were evicted from the town they lived in, these workers had created a tent colony outside of the plant. The national guard was stationed around the tent colony and the plant to keep violence to a minimum, but it didn’t work out as planned. On April 19th, 1914, gunshots rang out over the tent colony. Eyewitness accounts state: “Women, driven almost insane, ran like frightened hares into caves dug for their safety, their babes clutching frantically at their breasts, their older children tearing at their skirts, while around them fell the explosive bullets of the gunmen- militiamen.” Fighting continued throughout the day until the workers ran out of ammunition. Workers and their families retreated into the countryside or hid in cellars dug beneath their tents. Unfortunately, national guard troops then soaked the tents in kerosene and burned anyone still inside alive. 11 children and two women’s charred remains were found in one Cellar. The coal miners had lost this battle, but overall it was a victory for workers' rights because public attention was set on John D Rockafeller, the mastermind behind it all. The incident turned John D Rockafeller into a national villain and would symbolize a wave of industrial violence that would eventually lead to progressive era reforms in labor. (Walker, Mark)
	
After WW1, many progressive-minded activists and labor reformists would push for workers' rights. Many victories were won in this time, and one of those victories that impact us to this day is the creation of minimum wage. It started with the West Coast Hotel v Parish case, where the supreme court decided that employers paying below the state-enforced minimum salary was illegal. Overturning their previous decision with Adkins v Children Hospital where they had agreed that a minimum wage was unconstitutional.”The Adkins case construed an Act of Congress which had received the disapproval of the highest court of the District of Columbia. We, of course, conclude that the Act of Congress, not having received the approval of that court, was not a reasonable and proper remedy for a condition existing in the District of Columbia. If the Act of Congress so construed had been upheld by the highest court of the District of Columbia, then this Court would accept that judgment in the absence of any facts to support a contrary conclusion.” (West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish). These were some of the last bits of New Deal legislation to be passed. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) would establish a minimum wage, overtime work, a 44-hour workweek (This would be shortened to 40 hours later), and laws against child employment. (Grossman, Jonathan) The day before Roosevelt signed the bill, over one of his “Fireside chats,” he stated: “: "Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000 a day, tell you that a wage of $11 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry." (Roosevelt, Franklin) This was a massive victory for the progressives and workers in America. To this day, the Fair Labor Standards Act protects workers' rights and makes sure that they are treated fairly.
