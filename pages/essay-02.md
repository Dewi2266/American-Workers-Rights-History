# A Brief History ofWorker Right in the American 20th Century
## Introduction
  Americaâ€™s working conditions were not always safe or fair. By the early 20th century, most employees in America were overworked and underpaid for their labor. This caused many progressive-minded activists to fight for better working conditions and fair pay. Over the course of 70 years, working conditions would drastically change for the average American worker. By the end of the 20th Century, conditions would be nothing like they were in their earlier counterparts. This essay will discuss some of the most notable victories in the fight for workers' rights and some lesser-known conflicts that did not always succeed. This is a brief history of working conditions in the American 20th Century.
